How I go to sleep after a long and stressful day.

I own [Neurodreamer sleep mask](http://cornfieldelectronics.com/neurodreamer/nd.home.php), but noticed the "song" played isn't quite long enough in duration for me to fall asleep.  It works pretty well for me, the whole brainwave synchronization (entrainment) seems to have different effects on different folks, YMMV.  For me, the blinky lights don't seem to have much of an effect.

I'd used [Cool Edit](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adobe_Audition) for *forever*, back before it became Adobe Audition.

Attached is a Cool Edit script (sleep.scp) that produces the samples under samples/ - they're 44.1khz, stereo, 16 bit signed raw PCM.  Perfect for looping, and for piping through SoX's play command.

I use the 'sleepme' perl script to take care of all the looping and queueing of the sounds.  Works for me, tested last night.  Hope it works for you.  Enjoy.
